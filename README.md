## Features

- **Next.js**: Ghroovy utilizes Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, routing, and
  other optimizations out of the box. This Next.js project is configured with TypeScript, ESLint, and uses the
  app-router for routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling is done efficiently with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that speeds up
  development using utility classes.
- **Shadcn/UI**: The Shadcn/UI component library provides pre-designed, customizable components for building sleek user
  interfaces.
